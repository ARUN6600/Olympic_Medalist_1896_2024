# Data Cleaning Process:
1. Loading the Data: Imported the CSV and handled encoding issues.
2. Handling Missing/Truncated Data: Filled or removed incomplete rows; dealt with truncation by cross-verifying with known Olympic data sources.
3. Normalized country codes (e.g., "USA" to "United States").
4. Split athlete names and teams where commas indicated lists.
5. Standardized event names and genders (e.g., "Men's" into "men").

#Data Validation:
1. Export: Saved the cleaned data as a new CSV for use in Power BI.

#Tools Used
1. AI Assistance: GitHub Copilot for code autocompletion and suggestions; Grok AI for reasoning, tool.
2. Visualization: Power BI Desktop for dashboard creation.
